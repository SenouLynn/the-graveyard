// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

// ✔ Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
//   You can now open it in your favorite editor.

// warn You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add `.env` in it to not commit any private information.

// Next steps:
// 1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
// 2. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
// 3. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.
